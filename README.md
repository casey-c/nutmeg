### about
nutmeg is designed to manipulate [existential graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph) for propositional logic. it is a fully fledged assistant for the creation of visual proofs in a system where an eraser is the logician's most powerful tool.

### features
the first alpha release of nutmeg is scheduled to contain full editing capabilities for existential graphs. the second alpha release will focus on proof creation and adding inference/equivalence rules. our full schedule and planned features for development will be up on our wiki. we plan to update this readme as we hit major releases.
